Ex4Bugs
-------

We had only one small bug to fix in our ex4:
within the file "hujinet.js" after line 51 "socket.end()", we added the
line "socket.destroy()". The reason is the socket.end() doesn't promise the socket to get
close (at timeout in this case), it only sends FIN to the remote-end. This caused us an issue
where the other side (the browser) wasn't aware that the server has closed its connection, and
thus kept sending requests using the same socket. The call to destroys assures that both sides
are synchronized.
