Ex4Bugs
-------

We had only two small bugs to fix in our ex4:
1. within the file "hujinet.js" after line 51 "socket.end()", we added the line "socket.destroy()".
   The reason is that socket.end() doesn't promise the socket to get close (at timeout in this case),
   it only sends FIN to the remote-end. This caused us an issue where the other side (the browser) wasn't
   aware that the server has closed its connection, and thus kept sending requests using the same socket.
   The call to destroys assures that both sides are synchronized.
2. within the file "hujinet.js" we added the line "response = new httpResponseModule(socket);" after line 16.
   The reason is that in case of the ajax is received an internal error (with status 500), and send another request
   on the same socket, the returned status code was remained 500 (because this is the 'default value' we set).

In addition, we change the following two little things (they are not a real bugs):
1. it is not a bug, but within the file 'hujidynamicserver.js' we added the options to get '.png' images (line 169) for
   displaying the 'delete' to-do icon (we could use '.gif' instead..)
2. within the file "hujiparser.js" after line 117 we added the option to extract the body parameters from json object.
   we don't really need to use it (instead, we passed body params in the following format: "id=0&value=submit internet
   ex 5").
