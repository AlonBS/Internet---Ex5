                                    performed both in the client and server side (we do it in the server because we
                                    don't trust the client to do it. In addition, we do it in the client to reduce the
                                    server load).
 3      Success                     register new username with the following details:

 4      Failure                     trying to register another user with the same username ('liraz').
 5      Failure                     trying to login again with does not exist username (we verify that although the
                                    server's data module is not empty, we can't access the to-do list page).
 6      Failure                     trying to login with existing username ('liraz') but with wrong password.
 7      Success                     login with existing username ('liraz') and password ('abc123456').

 11     Failure                     trying to add another to-do with the same id (0).
 12     Success                     verify that the do-do we added was kept in the server, by getting all the user's
                                    to-do list (contains only this to-do).
 13     Success                     update the content and status of the item (id 0).
 14     Success                     verify that the do-do we updated was changed in the server as well (by getting all
                                    the user's to-do list (contains only this to-do)).
 15     Failure                     trying to update the content of does not exist item.

 18     Success                     verify that all the three to-do's were kept in the server.
 19     Success                     delete the third to-do (id 2).
 20     Success                     verify that the to-do indeed removed from the server (by getting all the user's
                                    to-do list).
 21     Success                     delete all the not completed to-do's.
 22     Success                     verify that the first to-do was removed (in test 13 we change its status to be
                                    'completed'), but the second is exists.
